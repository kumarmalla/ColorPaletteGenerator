Responsive Color Palette Generator
A powerful and intuitive web-based tool designed to help web developers and designers generate harmonious color palettes for their projects. This generator provides a live preview of how the colors look in a real website context, offers flexible adjustment options, and allows for easy export of generated palettes.

‚ú® Features
Flexible Color Input: Choose your base color using a color picker or by directly entering Hex, RGB, or HSL values.

Predefined Color Suggestions: Quickly select from a curated list of popular web accent colors and all Google Material Design accent colors.

Dynamic Palette Generation:

Monochromatic Theme: Generates a palette of 13 colors (7 for Light Mode, 6 for Dark Mode) based on HSL rules derived from your chosen base color, including primary, secondary, and tertiary backgrounds and text, plus an accent color.
